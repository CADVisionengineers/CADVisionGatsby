The solution can either be a custom feature inside an existing application or can be a standalone application which interacts with CAD and other systems. Programming languages like C, C++, Java, VB, C#, etc, are used to create interfaces or to develop independent applications.</p><p>A Sample list of custom solutions looks like this:<br />a. Utilities or Tools to improve productivity and reliability<br />b. Display CAD models in web browser<br />c. Value-added application development for Engineering Design<br />d. Applications for analysis and reporting<br />e. Domain specific custom CAD features to capture domain knowledge</p><p>CADVision leadership has rich experience in CAD and related industries and have the necessary expertise in tessellation, triangulation, faceted geometries and geometric kernels, required to provide start-to-end solutions in the manufacturer design workflow</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-3c8020d elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"3c8020d\" data-element_type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-d362a63\" data-id=\"d362a63\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-196d35e elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"196d35e\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Consulting:</h3>\n<p>\nCADVision specializes in the field of CAD and other related areas. Our consultants can help you deliver better products or services to your end users by increasing your design/process efficiency. Our consultants have rich experience and are there in business for so long that they understand your needs quickly, and can shift their focus in such a way so that you benefit the most out of our CAD Services.\n</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most engineering software provides a lot of flexibility either through their API for customization or through their ability to configure, which may not be completely listed anywhere. Our consultant’s specialization in the field ensures that your company has access to years of knowledge about the software, and how to create the best value you can.\nOur team will do an in-depth analysis of your design practices and procedures and will help you identify areas of opportunity for high ROI. We do prepare a comprehensive report of our work which will be suitable for making proposals to your upper management and for detailed budgeting purposes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4666bd1 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4666bd1\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Translational and Validation tools:</h3>\n\n<p>Translational tools are increasing in demand in every industry domain. Business collaboration between a supplier and a customer requires exchange of CAD files. While each CAD supports exporting to and importing from a standard CAD formats (STEP, IGES, STL, etc), a complete feature based exporting or importing is not possible. Translational is also required by companies when they decide to migrate from one CAD System to another CAD system. Attempting to migrate manually is a time and cost intensive activity.\n</p>\n<p>\nValidation tools are other important tools which companies use often. Sometimes, these validation tools are part of CAD software and sometimes 3rd utilities developed specific to a CAD system. Validation tool to check adherence to a specific standards is one example. Validation tool are also required during a translation or data migration process. Validation is the process of verifying that the resulting translated model or drawing is the same as the original source data. Most translation tools have an in-built validation tool which generates a validation report or log file, so that engineer can correct the errors manually. These in-built validation tools are not user friendly and identifying an error by looking at the report takes a lot of time. Having a good validation tool is to properly detect translational errors and detecting the design changes in the new model.\n</p>\n<p>\nCADvision provides the necessary consulting to identify the list of supported features by translational tools and does a market survey to see if there exists a ready to fit tool available in market. If such tool is not available in market, CADVision with in-house knowledge of various CAD software and their corresponding API information can help its customers in developing a custom feature based translational tool. A similar consulting and service is provided while developing a validation tool which will do a comprehensive validation as per the customer requirement. A tailored solution is not as expensive as it sounds and when compared to that of manual effort.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t","databaseId":829,"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"Custom Engineering Solutions","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAADCAIAAAAcOLh5AAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAjElEQVQI12OwXPjfcuF/8wUgZLHgvxkYmS9AiEAUQNHi/zZzv3lNfuC04JvFov8MFgv+Oyz577/6v8/q/36r/wet/e+/BsT1W/0/YM1/p2UgI+CaLRb+9+u5HFS/37vllMXsHwyWC/9bLfxvv+S/3WIQclgCYsORzSIUm60W/HVvOetac9iy9JDV1LcAkxluGykE1k8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=","aspectRatio":6.333333333333333,"src":"/static/857d21543da0a3c22bb4ad0cd47206cb/7a833/Custom-Engineering-Solutions-CADVision-Engineers.png","srcSet":"/static/857d21543da0a3c22bb4ad0cd47206cb/1b487/Custom-Engineering-Solutions-CADVision-Engineers.png 475w,\n/static/857d21543da0a3c22bb4ad0cd47206cb/ea52d/Custom-Engineering-Solutions-CADVision-Engineers.png 950w,\n/static/857d21543da0a3c22bb4ad0cd47206cb/7a833/Custom-Engineering-Solutions-CADVision-Engineers.png 1900w","sizes":"(max-width: 1900px) 100vw, 1900px"}}},"sourceUrl":"https://businesso.vigilant-burnell.147-182-171-252.plesk.page/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Custom-Engineering-Solutions-CADVision-Engineers.png"}},"seo":{"fullHead":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.9 -
