If we had used the conventional approach, it would have been very tedious and time consuming. We appreciate vectors functionality in CEAD which made it easy for us to do the force calculations. It also dynamically updated of calculations and results on change of geometry. We can study the effect of changing any independent variable and plot graphs, analyze and conclude on the best possible geometry. We validated the results and found the results obtained by CEAD were very close to results obtained by ADAMS and FEA.</p>\r\n\r\n                                    <div class=\"client-info\">\r\n                                        <div class=\"d-flex align-items-center\">\r\n                                            \r\n                                            <div class=\"title\">\r\n                                                <h3>AJAY WANI</h3>\r\n                                                <span> General Manager R &amp; D, IFB Automotive Pvt.

This is a vision that we shared with CADVision at the start and they have been able to deliver on that. we are able to speak directly with the people that actually do the work rather than with multiple layers of management.
